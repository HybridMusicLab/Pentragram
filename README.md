# Pentragram
MaxMSP external for automated, combinatorical snapshot morphing VSTs

## What's this for?
You can use Pentagram to record preset transitions from your VST program in a combinatorical way, meaning you can record the transition from every state to every state. Having 10 presets will thus yield 100 transitions, which are recorded via a batch process. This is useful if you want to partially conserve the behavior of a softsynth and turn it into a sampler later.

## How to use
Look at the patcher, you can pretty much work your way from top to bottom, it's pretty straighforward.
